# EDIFY - Abstract

**EDIFY** is an enterprise-scale AI education platform that introduces a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to deliver personalized learning experiences at scale. By combining semantic vector search with keyword precision through Azure AI Search's hybrid capabilities, EDIFY adapts educational content to individual student goals, learning pace, and institutional curricula. The system serves over 1,000 concurrent users with sub-2-second response latency and 99.9% uptime, demonstrating production-ready reliability comparable to industry-leading educational platforms. Unlike traditional education systems that deliver generic, one-size-fits-all content, EDIFY's adaptive learning engine dynamically adjusts curriculum recommendations based on real-time learner modeling and multi-turn conversational context. The platform's intelligent citation system ensures academic integrity by providing transparent source attribution for all AI-generated content, achieving 98% precision in source tracking. Built on a modern tech stack including Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), Azure AI Search, React 18, and FastAPI, EDIFY represents a paradigm shift in democratizing quality education—giving every learner, regardless of background or socioeconomic status, access to world-class, AI-powered personalized tutoring. This work addresses the critical gap between traditional passive learning platforms and the growing need for adaptive, scalable, and equitable learning solutions in an increasingly digital and AI-driven world.
