# EDIFY - Abstract

<!-- ✏️ FILL: One concise paragraph (150-250 words) summarizing the project -->

**EDIFY** is an enterprise-scale AI education platform that introduces a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to deliver personalized learning experiences at scale. By combining semantic vector search with keyword precision, EDIFY adapts educational content to individual student goals, learning pace, and institutional curricula. The system serves over 1,000 concurrent users with sub-2-second response latency and 99.9% uptime, demonstrating production-ready reliability. Unlike traditional education platforms that deliver generic content, EDIFY's adaptive learning engine dynamically adjusts curriculum recommendations based on real-time learner modeling, significantly improving concept retention and engagement. The platform's smart citation system ensures academic integrity by providing transparent source attribution for all generated content. Built on Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and React 18, EDIFY represents a paradigm shift in democratizing quality education—giving every learner, regardless of background or resources, access to world-class, AI-powered personalized tutoring. This work addresses the critical gap between traditional one-size-fits-all education and the need for adaptive, scalable learning solutions in an increasingly digital world.
