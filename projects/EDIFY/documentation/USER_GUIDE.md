## Using the AI Tutor

### Asking Effective Questions

**✅ Good Questions:**
```
- "Explain backpropagation with a simple example"
- "Compare gradient descent and Adam optimizer"
- "What prerequisites do I need to learn deep learning?"
- "Show me how to implement logistic regression in Python"
```

**❌ Less Effective Questions:**
```
- "Machine learning" (too vague)
- "Everything about AI" (too broad)
- "Help" (no specific topic)
```

### Question Types

**1. Conceptual Questions**
```
"What is the intuition behind gradient descent?"
```
*Best for: Understanding fundamental concepts*

**2. Comparison Questions**
```
"What's the difference between classification and regression?"
```
*Best for: Distinguishing similar concepts*

**3. How-To Questions**
```
"How do I implement a neural network in TensorFlow?"
```
*Best for: Practical implementation guidance*

**4. Debugging/Troubleshooting**
```
"Why is my model overfitting?"
```
*Best for: Solving specific problems*

### Understanding Citations

Every response includes citations:

```markdown
**Response:** "Gradient descent iteratively updates parameters..."

**Citations:**
1. Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016) - Page 87
   "The learning rate determines the step size..."
   Relevance: 95%

2. Pattern Recognition (Bishop, 2006) - Page 142
   "Optimization algorithms minimize the loss function..."
   Relevance: 89%
```

**Why citations matter:**
- ✅ Verify information accuracy
- ✅ Find additional resources
- ✅ Build academic integrity
- ✅ Explore source materials deeper

### Multi-Turn Conversations

EDIFY maintains context across the conversation:

**Example Session:**
```
Turn 1:
You: "Explain convolutional neural networks"
EDIFY: [Provides overview of CNNs]

Turn 2:
You: "What are the key hyperparameters?"
EDIFY: [Discusses CNN hyperparameters - kernel size, stride, padding]
       [Remembers we're discussing CNNs]

Turn 3:
You: "Show me an architecture for image classification"
EDIFY: [Provides CNN architecture example]
       [Context: CNNs + image classification]
```

## Tips for Effective Learning

### Best Practices

**1. Be Specific in Questions**
```
❌ "Tell me about Python"
✅ "How do Python decorators work with examples?"
```

**2. Build on Previous Conversations**
```
Session 1: Learn basics
Session 2: Explore applications
Session 3: Implement projects
```

**3. Use Follow-Up Questions**
```
Initial: "Explain gradient descent"
Follow-up: "Can you show the mathematical formulation?"
Follow-up: "What are common variants?"
```

**4. Set Learning Goals**
- Define clear objectives (e.g., "Build a CNN classifier")
- Break into smaller milestones
- Track progress weekly

**5. Review Regularly**
- Revisit concepts after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
- Use "Review" feature in dashboard
- Test understanding with practice problems

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

"Tell me everything about AI" → Too overwhelming

**❌ Not Following Up**
Get one answer and move on → Shallow learning
