# Axolotl - Abstract

**Axolotl** is an AI-powered football analytics platform that democratizes professional-level performance tracking for grassroots athletes. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques including YOLOv8 for player detection, DeepSORT for multi-object tracking, and custom LSTM models for movement prediction, Axolotl transforms standard match footage into actionable insights. The system provides real-time tactical feedback, personalized athlete metrics (technical, physical, and tactical), and long-term progress visualization—capabilities previously exclusive to elite teams with multi-million dollar budgets. Built on a GPU-accelerated microservices architecture with Redis queuing and Docker orchestration, Axolotl processes 60 FPS video in near real-time while maintaining scalability for concurrent match analysis. This work addresses the critical inequality in sports development where talent is abundant but access to professional-grade analytics remains limited to privileged few. By making data-driven performance insights accessible to any athlete with a smartphone camera, Axolotl levels the playing field and ensures that athletic potential—not financial resources—determines success.
